**The coursework involves a data analytic report.**

1) You should address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you are interested in (e.g., healthcare, sports, bioinformatics, gaming, finance, etc). 

2) If you are motivated in the subject matter, the project will be more fun for you, and you will likely produce a better report.

3) Once you determine the area that interests you the most, you should search for a suitable data set or collate the data set yourself (see Section 6 for some data sources)

4) You should apply TWO data analytic techniques of your choice.
